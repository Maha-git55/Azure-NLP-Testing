# Azure AI Language Services - NLP Features Testing

This project documents my hands-on testing of Azure AI Language services, exploring various natural language processing capabilities.

## üìã Project Overview

I tested multiple NLP features in Azure Language Studio to understand how AI processes and analyzes text. This included language detection, entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Services & Features Tested

- **Azure AI Language Service** - Core NLP service deployment
- **Language Studio** - Web-based interface for testing NLP features
- **Detect Language** - Identifying text language automatically
- **Named Entity Recognition** - Extracting people, places, organizations from text
- **Linked Entities** - Connecting entities to knowledge bases
- **Sentiment Analysis** - Determining positive/negative/neutral sentiment
- **Text Summarization** - Generating concise summaries from longer text

## üí° Key Learnings

- **Easy Setup**: Azure AI services are straightforward to deploy and configure
- **Accurate Results**: NLP features provided reliable analysis across different text types
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Language Studio makes complex AI accessible without coding
- **Practical Applications**: These services can power chatbots, content analysis, and data processing tools

## üîÆ Future Exploration

- Custom model training for domain-specific text analysis
- Integration with web applications using Azure SDKs
- Testing additional features like key phrase extraction and PII detection
